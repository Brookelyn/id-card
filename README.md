# Online ID card

I'm making a few assumptions:

1. The online ID card is part of the company's website and can be viewed on it.
2. This would be through the navigation that would normally be provided, such as 'About us > Our engineers' or something similar, which I haven't laid out - I've only concentrated on the ID 'card' itself.
3. The site's navigation would be branded, elimitating the necessity for display of the company logo elsewhere on the page as well as providing links to contact information for the company itself.

I've kept my folder structure very simple, as with a single page I didn't feel there was any need to create a folder specifically for the CSS or scripts that don't exist.

I used Bootstrap as a quick and easy way of making the page responsive and to give priority to the image, especially on a mobile. 

I included a Gas Safe Register number as any person working on boilers in the UK is required to be registered, or face prosecution. Were this live, this would take the user through to Paul's listing on the Gas Safe Register, which additionally lists the types of equipment he's qualified to work on. If this page were interactive, the question mark following Paul's Gas Safe Register number would also trigger a pop-up explaining what the register is and why it's relevent to the customer.

The 'About Paul' section could contain personal details - ie, family, football team, etc - talk about how long he's been with JMC Services and what he did before working there, or any other details the company may want to share.

Colours and more extensive design would be personalised to the company in question were this for a client, which would also involve the layout of any specific details that they wanted included.
